# WaMS_StudentInformationServicesRegistration_WebApp

WaMS stands for Web and Mobile Solutions: a sub-department of the Department of Information Technology (DoIT) at UW-Madison. Working within this team I helped build the Student Information System (SIS)-Registration application which is the client side of this application. The application can be used to view and register for courses inside the SIS department. There is a server side application that is paired with this application: SIS Admin.

This project contains features that were developed by 4 developers working in an agile/scrum team. The features I specifically worked on include:

Header - For this feature I used styling guidlines laid down by UW-Madison to build a header that met our needs. It contains links to login to this portal as well as links to UW-Madison's homepage. It contains a search bar that calls a search function built for this application. I also added the id's and classes to make the header responsive.

Navigation Bar - For this feature I added in dropdown menus and created links to other pages in the application. In addition, I added in id's and classes to make the styling consistent and make the Navigation bar mobile-friendly. Finally, I made the Navigaiton Bar sticky with some Javascript and CSS.

Footer - This feature needed to rely heavily on the web standard of our University (https://brand.wisc.edu/). Once these styling requirements were met I filled the footer with all the content requested by the client and made sure to include all the classes and id's required to maintain consistency throughout the application.
